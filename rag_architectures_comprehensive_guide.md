1. **Authentication**: Verify user identity and credentials
2. **Authorization**: Check user permissions for specific data access
3. **Data Classification**: Classify retrieved documents by sensitivity level
4. **Access Filtering**: Filter results based on user access rights
5. **Privacy Protection**: Apply data masking and anonymization as needed
6. **Secure Generation**: Generate responses with appropriate privacy controls
7. **Audit Logging**: Log all access and generation activities
8. **Compliance Check**: Ensure response meets regulatory requirements
